This conversion focuses on matching drivetrain ratios to the characteristics of the Lotus 907 engine and the realities of modern traffic, rather than chasing peak speed or novelty. Project Goals & Engineering Rationale The motivations for a 5-speed conversion fall into four practical engineering categories: Powerband utilization Mechanical sympathy at sustained speed Improved drivability in modern traffic Gear ratio optimization across the drivetrain Each is discussed below. 1. Powerband Utilization The Lotus 907 is a rev-happy engine, but the factory 4-speed forces awkward compromises: Large RPM drops between gears A choice between short gearing (fun) or tall gearing (tolerable cruising) No way to optimize both simultaneously From an engineering standpoint, this is a mismatch between engine characteristics and available ratios. A properly selected 5-speed provides: Closer intermediate ratios Improved torque multiplication during acceleration Smoother, more linear power delivery This is not about increasing peak output\u2014it is about keeping the engine where it works best . 2. Highway Cruising & Mechanical Sympathy With the stock 4-speed: 70 mph \u2248 high sustained RPM Elevated noise, vibration, and heat Increased long-term wear A 5-speed overdrive changes the equation: ~20\u201330% reduction in cruising RPM Lower average piston speed and friction losses Reduced oil temperature and cabin noise This is a longevity modification , not merely a comfort upgrade. Over thousands of miles, reduced cumulative mechanical stress matters. 3. Drivability in Modern Traffic The Jensen Healey was designed for: Slower highways Shorter trips Less congestion Modern traffic demands: Frequent speed changes Sustained high-speed cruising Confident merging and passing A 5-speed transmission: Improves throttle modulation in traffic Reduces the need for multiple downshifts Increases flexibility during passing and merging The car stops feeling \u201cperiod-correct difficult\u201d and starts feeling naturally usable . 4. Gear Ratio Optimization Most 5-speed conversions allow: Taller final drive ratios Retention of strong low-speed acceleration First gear optimized for launches, fifth for cruising Benefits include: Reduced wheelspin Improved traction off the line Better balance between torque, traction, and efficiency This is drivetrain systems engineering\u2014 not nostalgia management . Summary: Why This Is a Corrective Upgrade A well-executed 5-speed conversion: Signals thoughtful engineering Improves real-world usability Enhances desirability for people who actually drive their cars This is functional authenticity , not originality theater. Materials & Tools Major Components 5-speed transmission (source dependent) Appropriate bellhousing and/or adapter Modified or custom transmission mount Driveshaft modification (professional) Tools Standard hand tools Torque wrench Clutch alignment tool Optional (but historically recommended) Hammer Grease Crowbar Goat blood and chicken feet (Results may vary.) Before & After Before Insert image: stock 4-speed installation After Insert image: 5-speed installed Conversion Procedure Step 1: Admit the Truth Before turning a wrench, accept this: That 4-speed was fine in 1973. Today it\u2019s screaming along at 4,200 RPM like it\u2019s being chased. This is not betrayal. This is mechanical mercy . Step 2: Choose Your 5-Speed (Wisely) Select a gearbox that: Can actually handle the torque Has parts availability that doesn\u2019t involve calling a man named Nigel Fits without requiring structural violence Common choices include: Ford Type 9 (civilized, polite) Toyota W-series (sturdy, unbothered) If you find yourself saying \u201cthis one was cheap\u201d , stop. Cheap gearboxes are how projects become garage d\u00e9cor. Step 3: Remove the 4-Speed (Also known as: The Archaeological Dig) Disconnect and mark the driveshaft Drain oil that smells like regret Remove crossmember Lower gearbox slowly and directly onto your knuckles You will discover: One bolt you missed One mount that is definitely original Evidence of previous mechanics with\u2026 opinions Step 4: Bellhousing Alignment Shenanigans You will either: Use an adapter plate Swap bellhousings Or combine both while muttering Key rule: If the input shaft is not perfectly aligned, the gearbox will punish you later. This is where clutch alignment tools earn respect and eyeballing earns contempt. Step 5: Clutch & Flywheel Reality Check Since you are already here: Replace the clutch Verify spline compatibility Check throwout bearing travel Skipping this step means removing the gearbox again, which is an excellent way to test friendships. Step 6: Mounting & Crossmember The new gearbox will: Be longer Sit differently Laugh at your original crossmember Actions required: Modify or fabricate a mount Ensure correct driveline angle Avoid making it the lowest point on the car This is where mechanics become fabricators, willingly or not. Step 7: Driveshaft Math Your driveshaft will now be: Too long Too short Or theoretically correct but wrong in practice Solution: Professional length modification Proper balancing New U-joints Skipping this step results in vibrations that feel like the car is reconsidering your life choices. Step 8: Shifter Placement (The Human Interface Problem) Expect the shifter to: Appear in the wrong place Hit the console Emerge somewhere near your elbow Solutions include: Bent shifter Relocated tunnel opening Creative trim work Rule of thumb: Your hand should fall naturally onto the shifter, not go on a scavenger hunt. Step 9: Speedometer Lies Your speedometer will now: Lie Lie confidently Lie faster in 5th gear Fix via: Correct drive gear Ratio adapter Recalibration Ignoring this turns every drive into a legal gamble. Step 10: Fluids, Fasteners, and Final Checks Fill with the correct gearbox oil Torque everything Check clearances Inspect for leaks Realize you forgot something small This is normal. Panic is optional. Step 11: First Drive On the test drive: Shifts should be crisp No vibrations No new noises Fifth gear should drop RPM like a miracle If it does, congratulations. You have: Made the car quieter Made it faster in real life Extended engine lifespan Improved it without ruining its soul Final Mechanic\u2019s Verdict A 5-speed swap is not about speed. It is about: Not abusing the engine Not deafening yourself Not pretending it\u2019s still 1973 You didn\u2019t modernize the car. You fixed the compromise the factory had to make.","title":"5-Speed Transmission Conversion"},{"location":"5-speed-conversion/#converting-a-jensen-healey-from-4-speed-to-5-speed","text":"How to turn a perfectly adequate gearbox into a sensible one (or: \u201cHow to make your car nicer to live with without angering the gods of originality\u201d)","title":"Converting a Jensen Healey from 4-Speed to 5-Speed"},{"location":"5-speed-conversion/#overview","text":"Upgrading a Jensen Healey from the stock 4-speed to a 5-speed transmission is not a case of \u201cmore gears = more better.\u201d Done properly, it is a corrective engineering upgrade that materially improves drivability, longevity, and real-world performance\u2014without compromising the character of the car.
