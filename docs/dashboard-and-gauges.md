# <Project Title>  
*<Short subtitle or wry aside that hints at the problem being solved>*

---

## Overview

Briefly describe **what this sub-project is** and **why it exists**.  
This should answer, in 2–4 sentences:

- What problem are we solving?
- Why the factory solution was a compromise
- Why this change improves the car in the real world

Think: engineering context, not a build diary.

---

## Project Goals & Design Constraints

### Goals
List the concrete outcomes you wanted:

- Improve X without compromising Y
- Maintain serviceability
- Preserve vehicle character
- Integrate cleanly with existing systems

### Constraints
List the realities that shaped the design:

- Space limitations
- Heat management
- Weight distribution
- Parts availability
- Reversibility (if applicable)

This section signals **engineering maturity**.

---

## System-Level Rationale

Explain *why this approach was chosen* over alternatives.

Cover topics like:
- Architecture decisions
- Tradeoffs made
- Why certain “obvious” options were rejected
- How this subsystem interacts with others

This is where you quietly impress other engineers.

---

## Key Engineering Considerations

Break this into subsections as needed:

### Mechanical
- Packaging
- Mounting
- Loads
- Vibration

### Electrical / Electronic
- Power requirements
- Signal interfaces
- CAN / analog considerations

### Thermal
- Heat sources
- Cooling paths
- Failure modes

Only include what’s relevant for the project.

---

## Parts, Materials & Tools

### Major Components
- <Component name, spec, source>
- <Component name, spec, source>

### Fabrication & Custom Work
- Brackets
- Adapters
- Wiring harnesses
- Machining

### Tools
- Specialty tools
- Calibration equipment
- Software / firmware

*(Optional superstition section goes here, if earned.)*

---

## Before & After

### Before
> *Insert image(s): original configuration*

### After
> *Insert image(s): completed installation*

---

## Implementation Procedure

### Step 1: <Descriptive Step Name>

Explain **what happens**, not just *what to do*.  
Mention failure modes and “don’t do this” notes when relevant.

---

### Step 2: <Next Step>

Continue with numbered steps.  
Use humor sparingly, authority generously.

---

### Step N: Verification & Validation

- Torque checks
- Clearance checks
- Electrical continuity
- Software sanity checks

This section differentiates tinkering from engineering.

---

## Testing & Results

Describe:
- What was tested
- How it was tested
- What improved (qualitative or quantitative)

Include:
- RPM changes
- Temperature reductions
- Noise/vibration improvements
- Drive impressions

Data beats adjectives.

---

## Integration Notes

Document interactions with other systems:

- Cooling system
- Electrical system
- Interior ergonomics
- Service access

This is gold for anyone replicating or reviewing the work.

---

## Lessons Learned

Be honest:

- What you would do differently
- What worked better than expected
- What looked easy and wasn’t

This builds credibility faster than pretending perfection.

---

## Final Engineer’s Verdict

Summarize the **net effect** of the sub-project:

- What problem it solved
- Why it was worth doing
- Who this upgrade is *for* (and who it isn’t)

End with confidence, not hype.
