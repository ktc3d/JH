# T5 Transmission Conversion 
*Back in Spring ‘21, I swapped my transmission to a T5- this is how I did it.*

## Overview

Upgrading a Jensen Healey from the stock 4-speed to a 5-speed transmission is not a case of “more gears = more better.”  
Done properly, it is a **corrective engineering upgrade** that materially improves drivability, longevity, and real-world performance—without compromising the character of the car.

This conversion focuses on **matching drivetrain ratios to the characteristics of the Lotus 907 engine** and the realities of modern traffic, rather than chasing peak speed or novelty.

## Sourcing the transmission

I used a site called “Car-Part.com", which lets you search between the inventories of salvage yards nearby and afar. You should be searching for a manual transmission, denoted by “MT” in the model selection window, from a ‘95 Ford Mustang 3.8L Turbo. The site also searches for interchangeable parts, so don’t worry about this criteria being too specific. You should end up with a WC (“World Class”) with a ratio set of 3.35→1.99→1.33→1.00→0.68→R3.15. I ran this transmission with Strombergs and with EFI throttles on an effectively stock engine- while I have more power with the EFI all around- even with Strombergs, 5th was entirely usable as a cruising gear with poor, but present acceleration capabilities. Shifter placement is basically the same as the 4spd, but some minor modification is required (to the shifter) if you have the vinyl/chrome/wood center console style. (no info on the other center console style, sorry)

## 1. Notes on pilot bearings

TThe T5 we are sourcing has a larger input shaft diameter compared to the 4 speed’s, so the stock pilot bearing will not fit as things are. There are a couple things we can do about this - you can:

 

A: Turn down the transmission input shaft to match the 4 speed’s input shaft diameter

B: Find/Machine a pilot bearing with a 21mm OD and 17mm ID

 

I did option B, because I was pressed for time and budget, and frankly wasn’t interested in having both my engine and transmission apart. I ended up using a needle-style bearing from some tiller (yes, a tiller) and that worked, but I have trouble sleeping at night. If you’re going the custom bearing route, I would recommend a solid brass bearing- it’s simpler and the soft metal offers a less damaging failure scenario.

That all being said, turning down the input shaft is honestly the right way to do things. This lets you choose whatever input shaft diameters you like, allowing a higher strength roller bearing. I’d recommend turning it down to the 4 speed’s OD specification. If, for some reason, you want to go the needle bearing route I did, go search for the bearing using the following convention “IDxODxDepth”, in our case “17x21x17”.

 

(Something of note, the earlier T5 transmissions with a .72 overdrive (I think native to the 4cyl ‘stangs) have a smaller input shaft diameter that matches the OD of our 4 speeds. I noticed this when I bought the wrong clutch kit. The bearing included with this kit fits the 4 speed OD and the 907 crank ID. Do with this what you will.)

## 2. Mating the assembly

Assuming you have the transmission, bellhousing, and mating plate, congratulations, you’re ⅓ of the way there. Take the adapter plate and transmission and bolt them together with 4X 10.9-grade bolts, nuts, and lock washers. I also used red loctite because I really didn’t want this to fall off and my service interval is basically never. Now attach the bellhousing onto the adapter plate with 4X 10.9-grade bolts. You can use the 4 speed clutch arm and attach it to the 5 speed bellhousing’s pivot point. Modifying the throwout bearing to work with the 4 speed’s clutch arm is easy enough, it just needs to be grinded slightly on the contacts so that it fits in with the pegs on the clutch arm. With that all attached, now you’re ½ the way there. Nice.

## 3. Mating the engine

With everything together now, there’s nothing too special about what follows, if you’ve put a transmission on before, you can just skip this section … If you haven’t already, remove the old clutch pressure plate and disc. Keep the pressure plate, lose the disc. Remove the old pilot bearing (I like the bread method … Google it.) Clean out the bread and put in the new one, with a fair amount of grease. Get the splined installation tool from the LUK clutch kit, place the clutch disc on it (careful not to taint the surface), and place the end of the tool in the pilot bearing hole on the crankshaft. With that all centered, bolt on that JH pressure plate as evenly as you can, then remove the installation tool - the clutch is now installed.

From here on out, all you need to do is align the shaft of the transmission with the installed clutch and bolt the transmission and engine together. Mine needed a little convincing, but using the bolts to clamp the two together, it all worked out.

## 4. Driveshaft Business

Getting the driveshaft to agree with the new transmission isn’t all too bad. The driveshaft on both the 4 speed and the T5 is on a slip yoke, which gives us a little wiggle room, but we won’t need it. The T5’s output housing is a little farther out than the 4 speed - you can either order a custom driveshaft made of some fancy material that’s the perfect length with a higher power rating, or you can adapt the stock driveshaft, as I did. In cutting off the old U joint (and no more), and welding on the 1310 U Joint, my stock 4 speed driveshaft was the perfect length. The driveshaft shop I went to locally had the 1310 U Joint parts already in stock (they’re fairly common); they cut, welded, and balanced the shaft for $150, including the parts. The only thing I had to buy was the transmission side of the U joint, which adapted from the 1310 standard to the T5.

## 5. Shifter Business

The shifter location hardly changes, but the form factor does - the T5 has a higher shifter location- that in tandem with a tall rectangular shape, causes some slight clearance issues. I cut my T5 shifter in half, between the two threaded holes and used a 3D printed shifter piece. I have faith in 3D printing, but I don’t know anyone else who, in their right mind, would want a plastic shifter so feel free to make this from metal. Below, I’ve shared the design of the plastic piece I made, as a reference.
