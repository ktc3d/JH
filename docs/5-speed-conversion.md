# Converting a Jensen Healey from 4-Speed to T5 5-Speed  
*How to turn a perfectly adequate gearbox into a sensible one*  
*(or: “How to make your car nicer to live with without angering the gods of originality”)*

---

## Overview

Upgrading a Jensen Healey from the stock 4-speed to a 5-speed transmission is not a case of “more gears = more better.”  
Done properly, it is a **corrective engineering upgrade** that materially improves drivability, longevity, and real-world performance—without compromising the character of the car.

This conversion focuses on **matching drivetrain ratios to the characteristics of the Lotus 907 engine** and the realities of modern traffic, rather than chasing peak speed or novelty.

---

## Project Goals & Engineering Rationale

The motivations for a 5-speed conversion fall into four practical engineering categories:

- Powerband utilization  
- Mechanical sympathy at sustained speed  
- Improved drivability in modern traffic  
- Gear ratio optimization across the drivetrain  

Each is discussed below.

---

## 1. Powerband Utilization

The Lotus 907 is a rev-happy engine, but the factory 4-speed forces awkward compromises:

- Large RPM drops between gears  
- A choice between short gearing (fun) or tall gearing (tolerable cruising)  
- No way to optimize both simultaneously  

From an engineering standpoint, this is a mismatch between engine characteristics and available ratios.

A properly selected 5-speed provides:

- Closer intermediate ratios  
- Improved torque multiplication during acceleration  
- Smoother, more linear power delivery  

This is not about increasing peak output—it is about **keeping the engine where it works best**.

---

## 2. Highway Cruising & Mechanical Sympathy

With the stock 4-speed:

- 70 mph ≈ high sustained RPM  
- Elevated noise, vibration, and heat  
- Increased long-term wear  

A 5-speed overdrive changes the equation:

- ~20–30% reduction in cruising RPM  
- Lower average piston speed and friction losses  
- Reduced oil temperature and cabin noise  

This is a **longevity modification**, not merely a comfort upgrade. Over thousands of miles, reduced cumulative mechanical stress matters.

---

## 3. Drivability in Modern Traffic

The Jensen Healey was designed for:

- Slower highways  
- Shorter trips  
- Less congestion  

Modern traffic demands:

- Frequent speed changes  
- Sustained high-speed cruising  
- Confident merging and passing  

A 5-speed transmission:

- Improves throttle modulation in traffic  
- Reduces the need for multiple downshifts  
- Increases flexibility during passing and merging  

The car stops feeling “period-correct difficult” and starts feeling **naturally usable**.

---

## 4. Gear Ratio Optimization

Most 5-speed conversions allow:

- Taller final drive ratios  
- Retention of strong low-speed acceleration  
- First gear optimized for launches, fifth for cruising  

Benefits include:

- Reduced wheelspin  
- Improved traction off the line  
- Better balance between torque, traction, and efficiency  

This is drivetrain systems engineering—**not nostalgia management**.

---

## Summary: Why This Is a Corrective Upgrade

A well-executed 5-speed conversion:

- Signals thoughtful engineering  
- Improves real-world usability  
- Enhances desirability for people who actually drive their cars  

This is **functional authenticity**, not originality theater.

## Materials & Tools

### Major Components
- 5-speed transmission (source dependent)
- Appropriate bellhousing and/or adapter
- Modified or custom transmission mount
- Driveshaft modification (professional)

### Tools
- Standard hand tools
- Torque wrench
- Clutch alignment tool

### Optional (but historically recommended)
- Hammer  
- Grease  
- Crowbar  
- Goat blood and chicken feet  

*(Results may vary.)*

## Conversion Procedure

### Step 1: Admit the Truth

Before turning a wrench, accept this:

That 4-speed was fine in 1973.  
Today it’s screaming along at 4,200 RPM like it’s being chased.

This is not betrayal.  
This is **mechanical mercy**.

---

### Step 2: Choose Your 5-Speed (Wisely)

Select a gearbox that:

- Can actually handle the torque  
- Has parts availability that doesn’t involve calling a man named Nigel  
- Fits without requiring structural violence  

Common choices include:

- Ford Type 9 (civilized, polite)  
- Toyota W-series (sturdy, unbothered)  

If you find yourself saying *“this one was cheap”*, stop.  
Cheap gearboxes are how projects become garage décor.

---

### Step 3: Remove the 4-Speed  
*(Also known as: The Archaeological Dig)*

- Disconnect and **mark** the driveshaft  
- Drain oil that smells like regret  
- Remove crossmember  
- Lower gearbox slowly and directly onto your knuckles  

You will discover:

- One bolt you missed  
- One mount that is definitely original  
- Evidence of previous mechanics with… opinions  

---

### Step 4: Bellhousing Alignment Shenanigans

You will either:

- Use an adapter plate  
- Swap bellhousings  
- Or combine both while muttering  

**Key rule:**  
If the input shaft is not perfectly aligned, the gearbox will punish you later.

This is where clutch alignment tools earn respect and eyeballing earns contempt.

---

### Step 5: Clutch & Flywheel Reality Check

Since you are already here:

- Replace the clutch  
- Verify spline compatibility  
- Check throwout bearing travel  

Skipping this step means removing the gearbox again, which is an excellent way to test friendships.

---

### Step 6: Mounting & Crossmember

The new gearbox will:

- Be longer  
- Sit differently  
- Laugh at your original crossmember  

Actions required:

- Modify or fabricate a mount  
- Ensure correct driveline angle  
- Avoid making it the lowest point on the car  

This is where mechanics become fabricators, willingly or not.

---

### Step 7: Driveshaft Math

Your driveshaft will now be:

- Too long  
- Too short  
- Or theoretically correct but wrong in practice  

Solution:

- Professional length modification  
- Proper balancing  
- New U-joints  

Skipping this step results in vibrations that feel like the car is reconsidering your life choices.

---

### Step 8: Shifter Placement  
*(The Human Interface Problem)*

Expect the shifter to:

- Appear in the wrong place  
- Hit the console  
- Emerge somewhere near your elbow  

Solutions include:

- Bent shifter  
- Relocated tunnel opening  
- Creative trim work  

Rule of thumb:  
Your hand should fall naturally onto the shifter, not go on a scavenger hunt.

---

### Step 9: Speedometer Lies

Your speedometer will now:

- Lie  
- Lie confidently  
- Lie faster in 5th gear  

Fix via:

- Correct drive gear  
- Ratio adapter  
- Recalibration  

Ignoring this turns every drive into a legal gamble.

---

### Step 10: Fluids, Fasteners, and Final Checks

- Fill with the **correct** gearbox oil  
- Torque everything  
- Check clearances  
- Inspect for leaks  
- Realize you forgot something small  

This is normal. Panic is optional.

---

### Step 11: First Drive

On the test drive:

- Shifts should be crisp  
- No vibrations  
- No new noises  
- Fifth gear should drop RPM like a miracle  

If it does, congratulations. You have:

- Made the car quieter  
- Made it faster in real life  
- Extended engine lifespan  
- Improved it without ruining its soul  

---

## Final Mechanic’s Verdict

A 5-speed swap is not about speed.

It is about:

- Not abusing the engine  
- Not deafening yourself  
- Not pretending it’s still 1973  

You didn’t modernize the car.  
You fixed the compromise the factory had to make.
