## Top Five Interests 

Howdy! I'm Kieran Cunningham- an engineering and car enthusiast living in the Bay Area. I'm currently working as a Mechanical Engineer on the High Voltage Design team at Lucid Motors. Most of my free time is taken up working on my hybrid 1973 Jensen Healey. I'm fond of industrial design, walking great distances, and tuna melts from Izzy's Bagels.
