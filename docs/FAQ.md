## Frequently Asked Questions 


**General**
- *Why a Jensen Healey?*
    - For my first project car, I knew I wanted something British. I feel that style/value ROI on British cars is unparalleled by any other marque nationality. Now, *which* British car is truly the question. Of the Brits, the Jensen stood out as a modern and unique option- featuring unibody construction and a twin cam engine.


**Hybrid System**

- *Wait- Where's the clutch?*
    - It goes Engine -> **Clutch** -> Electric Motor -> Transmission
- *Can you drive 'EV only'?*
    - Yes! Because of the above arrangement, pressing the clutch in allows the car to drive completely electric. I once drove like this to a nearby Jiffy-Lube to get the oil changed, and showed up with a completely cold engine ... the staff were a tad confused.
- *Does it regen when you brake?*
    - Yes! If the brake is depressed, the clutch is not engaged (negated if Engine RPM > 0), and the car is not in neutral- braking will trigger regen braking.
- *How much horsepower does the electric motor add?*
    - I haven't run it on the dyno yet, but the inverter will pump up to 100kw (134hp) into the motor. 
- *Does the battery charge when you drive with just gas?*
    - It depends on the driving mode and how much throttle you're giving it, but in general, I have the motor tuned to siphon ~0.5kw (0.7hp) from the engine during highway driving. It's not a ton of charging power, but it's a enough to support the occasional scoot.
